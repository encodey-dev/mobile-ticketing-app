Mobile app source code

We offer a complimentary mobile application along with its source code, fully customizable with your logo and preferred payment method. This allows customers to purchase tickets directly through the app.

The application supports buying mobile passes and recharging MIFARE cards.

The system is configured to accept Authorized.net as a payment gateway.

INSTRUCTIONS: Copy the env file to .env and update the variables with your specific values.

AUTHENTICATION: The system is pre-configured for basic authentication using Firebase. Please note, the source code will not include GoogleService-info.plist or google-services.json files.
